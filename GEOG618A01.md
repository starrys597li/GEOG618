## Question 2. Read more about OSM data model and find out the meaning of Node, Way and Relationships Compare them with Point, Polygon and line objects. Write one paragraph about it and also show the type of the relation between those entities (one-to-one, many-to-one and so on). (8 marks)

OpenStreetMap (OSM) works as a free, open, and global database that contains geospatial data from covering the entire world (Geoapify, 2019). Geospatial data in the OSM data model are stored in a simple data structure, which consists of interrelated nodes, ways, and relationships. A node in the OSM model indicates a pointlike entity with ID identifier, latitude, and longitude (Eindhoven University of Technology, n.d.). For example, a node can represent a point of interest, such as a bus stop, a streetlamp, a gas station, etc. A way is a sequence of connected nodes that form a linear feature, it always refers to a non-pointlike entity, such as polyline and polygon. Ways can represent many features, including roads, railways, administrative borders, etc (Eindhoven University of Technology, n.d.). A relationship in OSM is an ordered list of nodes, ways, or other relationships that share a common attribute or purpose (Eindhoven University of Technology, n.d.). Relationships can be used to model complex features such as roads for a bus route, a lake and its islands, etc. 

In GIS, point, line, and polygons are the basic geometric objects used to represent spatial data. Normally, a point indicates a single location in space, a line is a sequence of points that represents a path or a linear feature, and a polygon is an enclosed area. 

In comparison, node, way and relationships are different from point, line, and polygons from many aspects. Firstly, point, line, and polygons represent geographic features while node, way and relationships are topological elements. This implies that there are two options for dealing with features; geographic features are defined based on their coordinates, while topological features are shown as a sequential arrangement of their topological components in a graph (Esri, n.d.). Secondly, the relationships between OSM entities and geographic features are different. Since a node can composite one or more ways, and a way can contain multiple nodes, the relationship between these topological features in OSM can be one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many. Besides, relationships can link multiple nodes and ways to create complex features such as routes and land uses. However, the relationship between point, polygon, and line objects in GIS is often one-to-one. These geographic features all exist individually; a single point represents a single location, a single line represents a single path, and a single polygon represents a single area.

## Question 3. In the step 1.3.2 we have a term called view. What are the views in the database and what is their use? Write one paragraph about it. (5 marks)
In a database management system, a database view is a subset of a database that represents a specific subset of data obtained from one or more database tables, typically through a query. These views are stored in the database as named queries and can be useful for saving complex and commonly used queries (IBM, 2021). A view in database has many uses:

1. Simplifying complex queries: Views can be used to simplify complex queries by providing a simpler and more intuitive interface to the underlying data (Datacamp, n.d.). The utilization of views enables the partitioning of complicated queries into less intricate and more feasible components. For example, if the table has thousands of rows and you would like to write a query, you can only retrieve the first 15 rows using view. It will cost less time to run the query for viewing the atrributes.
2. Data consistency: Views can be used to enforce data consistency by providing a standardized way of accessing and updating data across multiple tables. This can help ensure that data is accurate and up-to-date. 
3. Data security: Views can be used to restrict access to sensitive data by limiting the columns and rows that users can access. This can help ensure that sensitive information is not accessed or modified by unauthorized users (SAP, n.d.). Through a view, the users can only edit the data they can see.
5. Performance Improvement: Views can be used to improve performance by precomputing complex queries and storing the results in the view. This can help reduce the amount of processing required to execute complex queries and improve response times.
6. Application development simplification: Views can simplify the development of applications by providing a consistent and predictable way of accessing data. This can help reduce the amount of code required to build applications and improve overall application performance.

## Question 4. In section Visualizing Data we manually found the node id. Write a simple sql query to find the closest node id to a point from a lat and lng value. (5 marks)

```sql
SELECT id, lon, lat, ST_Distance(ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(lon,lat), 4326), ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(-80.96862697511344,43.37441226789755), 4326)) AS distance
FROM ways_vertices_pgr
ORDER BY distance ASC
LIMIT 1; 
```
